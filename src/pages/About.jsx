          <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm <span className="font-semibold text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400">Aryan Patel</span>, a passionate B.Tech Computer Science student with a strong foundation in
            programming and web development.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            I love turning ideas into beautiful and functional websites. My journey started with HTML & CSS, and I quickly dove into JavaScript, C++, Python, and frameworks like React and Tailwind CSS.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Iâ€™ve built several projects ranging from weather apps to multi-page PokÃ©mon wikis, always trying to learn something new and push my limits. I'm also enthusiastic about UI/UX, problem-solving, and making the web a better place.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            When Iâ€™m not coding, you might find me exploring tech content, gaming, or just vibing with music. My goal is to grow as a full-stack developer and build impactful digital experiences ðŸš€.
